1- How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
    * creat a file using (touch) command like test.txt
    * Use (mv) command and to rename the file with (.) before it
	mv test.txt .test.txt
    * then I can use (ls) command to make sure it's hidden
    * to display the hidden files we can use (ls -a) then it's going to show hidden files as well.

2- How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
    * using (mkdir -p) then typing a full length that we need

3- How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character
    *using (echo sentence >> filename) like I did now
